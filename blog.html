            <h2>How To Read</h2>
            <p>Reading for beginners can be a little tough. But, with time, the speed and level of imagination will eventually increase. It might become a little hard to build focus at the very start, you might feel distracted and disconnected in your initial days. But trust me, it is all about having "Patience". Just trust the process and allow yourself to fall in love with reading. These are some tips for fellow readers which they can follow but not necessarily, do what works for you the best.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="howtoread">
                <li>Create your corner for reading. Let it be your quiet space where you can just be yourself and read. Keep your books there, install warm coloured lights. Custmosise the room with your choices.</li>
                <li>If you are a beginner, try timer-based reading. Set time for yourself everyday. Give yourself time to adjust and to be able to read more when this new hobby becomes habit.</li>
                <li>Avoid touching your phone at all while reading. This will help you be more focused and enjoy the process more.</li>
                <li>Avoid using dictionaries and searching for words too often. You might understand the meaning of a word as you read the upcoming sentences. Being stuck, reduces fluency and speed.</li>
                <li> Journaling about what you read in a day, whenever you get time. This makes you get involved more in the process.</li>
